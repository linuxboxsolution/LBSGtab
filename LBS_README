Due to Popular Demand I have decided it is mandatory to start Providing
Document Tracking & Change Log's. To any who truly care I apologize for 
not keeping track of my coding earlier I didn't think anyone would care so
much as to start fights in my threads in the forums and have users drop
forums just to join others.

So if you want support by me on anything you will have to register at 
TabletModz.com and post it in the proper Forum. This would Go Into the
Kernel Forum So if you have a question for me as a developer drop me a line
there either I or someone else will help you. 

As for right now we will not provide support any other way but will support
anyone that has any question. If we cannot provide the answer for you then
we will try to help you find the best possible route to finding the answer.
