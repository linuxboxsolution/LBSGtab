Due to Popular Demand I have decided it is mandatory to start Providing
Document Tracking & Change Log's. To any who truly care I apologize for 
not keeping track of my coding earlier I didn't think anyone would care so
much as to start fights in my threads in the forums and have users drop
forums just to join others.

So if you want support by me on anything you will have to register at 
TabletModz.com and post it in the proper Forum. This would Go Into the
Kernel Forum So if you have a question for me as a developer drop me a line
there either I or someone else will help you. 

As for right now we will not provide support any other way but will support
anyone that has any question. If we cannot provide the answer for you then
we will try to help you find the best possible route to finding the answer.

This Kernel Source is Fully Updated with Pershoot's Source updates as of 7/2/11
Here is my Credit to Pershoot for anyone who is worried about this.


7/10/2011 Revision!!!! 

Sorry But Like I said in the forums you can come to my site and use the contact form to contact us directly for support no registration required.

Sorry to any users on SlateDroid they only read this README file and hadn't read anything I posted in the other forums so they have banned me assume ng I would make anyone register for Support. I tried explaining this to them but they don't want to hear shit and they are very ungrateful of there users and developers. 

If only I would have screen captured there messages. Also they have tried to say they will force XDA-Developers to BAN me also. I don't know if this is true or not but if they do sorry to any XDA members beforehand.

You can personally thank the asshole MRSBURNOUT for everything. They have even banned me from viewing the forum. Not like I cannot create a new login and from one of the other 3,000 IP's I own but yeah. 

So Anyways Sorry for any misinterpretation about the support.
